/**
 * Calculates the Julian Epoch value of the specified Gregorian calendar. This does not take

 *
 * In astronomy, an epoch is a specific moment in time for which celestial coordinates or
 * orbital elements are specified, and from which other orbital parametrics are thereafter
 * calculated in order to predict future position. The applied tools of the mathematics
 * disciplines of Celestial mechanics or its subfield Orbital mechanics (both predict
 * orbital paths and positions) about a center of gravity are used to generate an
 * ephemeris (plural: ephemerides; from the Greek word ephemeros = daily) which is a
 * table of values that gives the positions of astronomical objects in the sky at a given
 * time or times, or a formula to calculate such given the proper time offset from the
 * epoch. Such calculations generally result in an elliptical path on a plane defined by
 * some point on the orbit, and the two focii of the ellipse. Viewing from another
 * orbiting body, following its own trace and orbit, creates shifts in three dimensions
 * in the spherical trigonometry used to calculate relative positions. Over time,
 * inexactitudes and other errors accumulate, creating more and greater errors of
 * prediction, so ephemeris factors need recalculated from time to time, and that
 * requires a new epoch to be defined. Different astronomers or groups of astronomers
 * used to define epochs to suit themselves, but these days of speedy communications, the
 * epochs are generally defined in an international agreement, so astronomers world wide
 * can collaborate more effectively. It was inefficient and error prone to translate data
 * observed by one group so other groups could compare information. An example of how
 * this works: if a star's position is measured by someone today, he/she then obtains the
 * change that occurred in the reference frame position since J2000 and corrects the
 * star's position appropriately, yielding the position of the star relative to the
 * reference frame of J2000. It is this J2000 position which is shared with others.<br><br>
 *
 * Therefore, the current epoch, defined by international agreement, is called J2000.0
 * and is precisely defined to be:<br>
 * 1. The Julian date 2451545.0 TT (Terrestrial Time), or January 1, 2000, noon TT.<br>
 * 2. This is equivalent to January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI (International Atomic Time) or<br>
 * 3. January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).<br><br>
 *
 * A Julian year, named after Julius Caesar (100 BCE ï¿½ 44 BCE), is a year of exactly
 * 365.25 days. Julian year 2000 began on 2000 January 1 at exactly 12:00 TT. The
 * beginning of Julian years are indicated with prefix 'J' and suffix '.0', for example
 * 'J2000.0' for the beginning of Julian year 2000. Because Julian years have a fixed
 * length, their beginning is far easier to calculate than that of Besselian years.<br><br>
 *
 * The IAU decided at their General Assembly of 1976 that the new standard equinox of
 * J2000.0 should be used starting in 1984. (Before that, the equinox of B1950.0 seems to
 * have been the standard.) If the past is a good guide, then we may expect to switch to
 * J2050.0 in the mid-2030s. Julian epochs are calculated according to:<br>

/**
 * Calculates the Earth eccentricity given the number of centuries since 2000.<br><br>
 *
 * In astrodynamics, under standard assumptions, any orbit must be of conic section shape.
 * The eccentricity of this conic section, the orbit's eccentricity, is an important
 * parameter of the orbit that defines its absolute shape. Eccentricity may be interpreted
 * as a measure of how much this shape deviates from a circle.<br><br>
 *
 * The eccentricity of the Earth's orbit is currently about 0.0167. Over thousands of
 * years, the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit varies from nearly 0.0034 to almost 0.058
 * as a result of gravitational attractions among the planets.<br><br>
 *
 * Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area
 * of the Earth's orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital
 * eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion)
 * can be substantially longer in duration. Today, northern hemisphere fall and winter
 * occur at closest approach (perihelion), when the earth is moving at its maximum
 * velocity. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, fall and winter are slightly
 * shorter than spring and summer. In 2006, summer was 4.66 days longer than winter and
 * spring is 2.9 days longer than fall. Axial precession slowly changes
 * the place in the Earth's orbit where the solstices and equinoxes occur. Over the next
 * 10,000 years, northern hemisphere winters will become gradually longer and summers will
 * become shorter. Any cooling effect, however, will be counteracted by the fact that the
 * eccentricity of Earth's orbit will be almost halved, reducing the mean orbital radius
 * and raising temperatures in both hemispheres closer to the mid-interglacial peak. [5]<br><br>

 * axial tilt is expressed as the angle made by the planet's axis and a line drawn through
 * the planet's center perpendicular to the orbital plane.
 *
 * The Earth currently has an axial tilt of about 23.37ï¿½. The axis remains tilted in the

 * (half part of earth) tilted away from the Sun will gradually become tilted towards the
 * Sun, and vice versa. This effect is the main cause of the seasons (see effect of sun

/**
 * Calculates the equation of time given the specified parameters.<br><br>
 *
 * The equation of time is the difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time,
 * both taken at a given place (or at another place with the same geographical longitude)
 * at the same real instant of time.<br><br>
 *
 * Apparent (or true) solar time can be obtained for example by measurement of the current
 * position (hour angle) of the Sun, or indicated (with limited accuracy) by a sundial.
 * Mean solar time, for the same place, would be the time indicated by a steady clock set
 * so that its differences over the year from apparent solar time average to zero (with
 * zero net gain or loss over the year).<br><br>
 *
 * The equation of time varies over the course of a year, in way that is almost exactly
 * reproduced from one year to the next. Apparent time, and the sundial, can be ahead
 * (fast) by as much as 16 min 33 s (around November 3), or behind (slow) by as much as
 * 14 min 6 s (around February 12).<br><br>
 *
 * The equation of time results from two different superposed astronomical causes, each
 * causing a different non-uniformity in the apparent daily motion of the Sun relative to
 * the stars, and contributing a part of the effect:<br>
 * -the obliquity of the ecliptic (the plane of the Earth's annual orbital motion around
 *  the Sun), which is inclined by about 23.44 degrees relative to the plane of the Earth's
 *  equator; and<br>
 * -the eccentricity and elliptical form of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.<br><br>
 *
 * The equation of time is also the east or west component of the analemma, a curve
 * representing the angular offset of the Sun from its mean position on the celestial
 * sphere as viewed from Earth.<br><br>
 *
 * The equation of time was used historically to set clocks. Between the invention of
 * accurate clocks in 1656 and the advent of commercial time distribution services around
 * 1900, one of two common land-based ways to set clocks was by observing the passage of
 * the sun across the local meridian at noon. The moment the sun passed overhead, the
 * clock was set to noon, offset by the number of minutes given by the equation of time
 * for that date. (The second method did not use the equation of time, it used stellar
 * observations to give sidereal time, in combination with the relation between sidereal
 * time and solar time.) The equation of time values for each day of the year,
 * compiled by astronomical observatories, were widely listed in almanacs and ephemerides. [7]<br><br>
